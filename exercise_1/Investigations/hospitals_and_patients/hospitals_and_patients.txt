Using the overall score from the hospitals entity, we find that the correlation with the survey base score
is 0.445.  We find that this is a good base way of measuring the base correlaton without introducing too 
much variability.  However, we might note that instead of using a categorical rating from 1-5, we instead want 
to use our composite, created earlier, for a more accurate reading.
