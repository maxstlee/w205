To determine best state, we decided an average aggregate of the overall
rating from the restructured hospital general information would be a good
indicator.  While it is true that there is a significant amount of more
granular information available in the procedures finals, we believe that 
incorporating the range of procedures introduces too much variability under 
which a generic state-wide comparision cannot be effectively used.  We
also noted that some of the survey data did not fully cover all the hospitals.
Even though we removed entries that did not have the scoring available, we believe
this is a clean, generic method without introducing too much specificity.
